                question: "A technician needs to install several external USB devices to a computer. The technician installs the devices and sees they are recognized by the system but are not functioning properly. What is the MOST likely cause of the issue?",
                options: [
                    "The USB devices need to be connected to a powered USB hub.",
                    "The USB cable lengths exceed the maximum specification.",
                    "The USB ports are not providing enough power to the devices.",
                    "The USB drivers need to be updated in the operating system."
                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "If external USB devices are recognized but not functioning properly, it's most likely because the USB ports aren't providing enough power. Many USB devices require more power than a standard USB port can provide, especially when multiple devices are connected. A powered USB hub would be the solution to this problem.",

                question: "A user reports that whenever they try to connect to their corporate VPN from home, the connection fails with an error about the security certificate. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?",
                options: [
                    "The company's VPN server certificate has expired.",
                    "The user's router is blocking VPN traffic.",

                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "Certificate errors are often caused by incorrect date and time settings on the client device. If the computer's date is set incorrectly, it may think a valid certificate is expired or not yet valid. This is a common issue with VPN connections that rely on certificate-based authentication.",

                options: [
                    "Replace the power supply.",
                    "Verify the monitor is functioning correctly.",

                    "Reseat the memory modules."
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "Following the CompTIA troubleshooting methodology, the first step should be to verify the most basic components are working. In this case, before assuming there's an issue with the computer itself, the technician should verify that the monitor is functioning correctly. It's possible the computer is booting correctly but there's an issue with the display.",

                    "802.11g",

                ],
                answer: 3,
                explanation: "802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands and offers a maximum theoretical throughput of up to 9.6 Gbps, though 6.9 Gbps is a common implementation. 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) operates only in the 5 GHz band but has a lower maximum throughput of about 3.5 Gbps.",

                question: "A technician needs to connect a computer to a network and install drivers for a printer. After connecting an Ethernet cable, the technician notices the link light on the NIC is not illuminated. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?",
                options: [
                    "The Ethernet cable is a crossover cable.",
                    "The NIC drivers are not installed.",
                    "The Ethernet cable is damaged or not properly connected.",
                    "The computer's firewall is blocking the connection."
                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "If the link light on the NIC is not illuminated after connecting an Ethernet cable, the most likely cause is a physical connectivity issue - either the cable is damaged, not properly seated in the port, or there's no connection at the other end of the cable. The link light indicates a physical connection, which occurs before any software drivers or firewall settings would come into play.",

                options: [
                    "The battery needs to be calibrated.",
                    "Too many applications are running in the background.",
                    "The screen brightness is set too high.",
                    "The device is connected to a weak cellular signal."
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "If a smartphone is draining battery quickly and feels warm when not in use, it's most likely because there are too many applications running in the background consuming system resources. Background apps use processing power and network connections, which leads to increased battery drain and device heating.",

                question: "A technician is replacing a failed hard drive in a RAID 5 array consisting of four drives. After replacing the drive, which of the following will occur?",
                options: [
                    "The array will automatically rebuild.",
                    "The array must be manually rebuilt using the RAID controller software.",
                    "The operating system will detect the new drive and format it.",
                    "The RAID array must be completely recreated from a backup."
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "After replacing a failed drive in a RAID 5 array, the array typically needs to be manually rebuilt using the RAID controller software or BIOS utility. While some enterprise-level RAID controllers may support automatic rebuilding, in most cases, the technician needs to initiate the rebuild process after the physical replacement.",

                question: "A technician needs to install a new graphics card in a PC. After installation, the computer powers on but there is no display output. The fans on the graphics card are spinning. Which of the following should the technician check FIRST?",
                options: [
                    "If the graphics card is compatible with the motherboard.",
                    "If the additional power connectors for the graphics card are connected.",
                    "If the display is connected to the correct output port.",
                    "If the latest graphics drivers are installed."
                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "When troubleshooting a new graphics card installation where the card appears to be receiving power (fans spinning) but there's no display, the first thing to check is whether the display cable is connected to the correct output port. A common mistake is leaving the monitor connected to the motherboard's integrated graphics output instead of connecting it to the new graphics card's ports.",

                options: [
                    "DHCP",
                    "NAT",

                    "VPN"
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "Network Address Translation (NAT) is specifically designed to allow multiple devices to share a single public IP address. It works by maintaining a table of private IP addresses and ports, mapping them to the single public IP with different ports. This is a standard feature in home routers that allows all home devices to connect to the Internet.",

                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is specifically designed to separate public-facing servers from the internal network. It creates a buffer zone where public-facing servers can be accessed from the Internet while keeping the internal network protected and inaccessible. This is a standard security practice for business networks with public services.",

                answer: 1,
                explanation: "If a user can access other network resources but not a specific shared folder that was previously accessible, the most likely cause is that the user's permissions for that specific folder have been revoked or modified.
